Starforge is an experimental map editor for Celeste. **It is still in very early development, and may never reach a usable state.** If you are interested in creating maps, you are better off taking a look at [Ahorn](https://github.com/CelestialCartographers/Ahorn) for now.

# Compiling from Source
To compile from source, you can clone this repository and then build using Visual Studio or the toolkit of your choice. Make sure to recursively clone submodules and restore NuGet packages if necessary. You will need a build of FNA and its associated libraries to run Starforge. FNA is provided as a submodule which you can build yourself, and the native libraries can be found on [the wiki.](https://fna-xna.github.io/download/) Place the native libraries in the output directory containing `Starforge.exe`.
